Fix Null. Exception when pressing add button

Include the LinksView.XML directly in the RootView.fxmland give it
an id(linksView) to refer to instead of using a method to embed it 
(LinksView) in the center of RootView.

Refer this id in the RootViewController in order to have access to
the referenced rootPane object and to its Controller.

Setup the LinksViewController when initializing the RootViewController
in order to load the main application with this view opening and the
important variable of the LinksView initialized.

Doing like that avoid using another method in the main App to set up
the link view and then embed it with a java code into the root view.
